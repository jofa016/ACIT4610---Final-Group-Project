# Human immunity system
- the immune system learns what your own cells looks like 
- then it creates detectors(immune cells) that are trained not to attack anything that looks like you

# Arteficial immunity system
- inspired by human immunity system uses the same mechanism

## Negative Selection Algorithm
- is type of Arteficial immunity sytem algorithm
- learn pattern from ham messages
- generate a bunch of detectors
- eliminate any detector that match the self pattern
- keep the remaining detectors
- when a new message comes, if it matches any detector- mark it as spam
